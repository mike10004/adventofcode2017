## Tutorial Reference

The Advent of Code challenges are good brain exercises, but I also use them as 
opportunities to try new programming languages and tools and to flex muscles
that have atrophied from disuse. Each day serves as a small exercise of a 
particular topic that I can refer back to as a tutorial when I need it.
